 

ORATIO PRO ARCHIA POETA. 63

that γοα receive in good part that which has been said.
10. If the Iliad had not been written, the valor of Achilles
'would not have been an incentive to toils and dangers
among all races. 11. If the reward of praise is taken
away, we shall 'not contend for glory at the peril of our
lives. 12. Since Archias is of that number who has always
been received under our protection‚ we ought to assist him
with our kindness. 13. All who are engaged in public
business are urged on by the incentive to glor-y, and desire
an eternal testimony of praise. 14. We are not so narrow-
minded as to suppose that the soul looks forward to nothing
in the future. 15. In the city in which statues and images
of the body¹ have been left by the most eminent men,
shall we not leave a representation of our virtues?

LATmE semet.

Alexander the Great said that Achilles was fortunate
because he found Homer as the panegyrist of his glory;
Pompey gave citizenship to Theophanes the Mitylenaean‚
and [his] action² was approved by the soldiers3 and a bad
poet of the people was presented with a reward by Sulla.
Could not this man, then, who has been sought by many
citie8‚ and who has 3celebrated the deeds ·of the Roman
people, have obtained citizenship from his friends, Metellus
Pius and the Luculli? ⁸

But Ι must speak briefiy in accordance with my custom.

· Ι trust that you have received in 'good part what I have

said3 that you will preserve a man of such virtues and
and xgenius that it has been testified to by the Heraclean
municipality‚ by LuculluS, and the tablets of Metellus; and
that γοα will receive under your protection this poet, who
has always done honor to the exploits of your generals and
of the Roman people.
