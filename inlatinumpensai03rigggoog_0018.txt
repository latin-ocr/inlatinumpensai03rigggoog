14 ΙΝ LATINUM.

recognizes that his presence wounds the feelings 01 611, yet
he ¹is unwilling to withdraw from those who hate him and
to leave the city. The country has 101· 6 long time con-
sidered that he neither respects her authority nor dreads
1161· power, but is plotting concerning the slaughter 01
many 'citizens and even her own destruction. Wherefore
she commands that he depart and free her from 1661.

VIII. For the sake 01 avoiding suspicion, Catiline said
⁴ that he was willing to' give himself into custody.· He asked .
that he might dwell at the house 01 Manius Lepidus, 01
Cicero, 01· 01 Quintus MetelluS, the praetor, but he was re-
jected by them all. Then his boon companion, Marcus
MetelluS, said that he would keep Catiline at his home.
Oatssine, advised by Cicero to go into exile, says he‘will
comply 11 the senate decrees that it is its pleasure that
he go into other lands and commit his 1116 to flight and
solitude.

IX. Catiline 16 not 611611 6 111611 66 to be frightened by
my voice and induced to go into exile. If, recalled by
shame from baseness, by 1661· from danger, or by reason
from madneSS, he should meditate ssight, a storm 01 unpopu-
larity would threaten me. But it 16 worth while, provided he
will separate himself from the good, ‘and go >out with his
wanton band 01 misereants. And yet, why should I with

difficulty endure the remarks 01 111611, 611166 Ι know that q

Catiline has agreed upon a day with ManliuS, and has sent
forward that silver eagle, which I hope will be fatal to him
and all his [friends]?
