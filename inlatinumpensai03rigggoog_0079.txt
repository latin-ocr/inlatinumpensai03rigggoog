EPISTOLAE snLEo'rAE. 75

As to your urging me to write to you from near
Tarentum on the 14th of April, let me say, Ι 8111 so broken·
spirited that when Ι want to write Ι 8111 overcome with
tears. When I read your lettere, I can hardly keep from
doing violence ιο myself. Against my staying in Epirus, ’
in the first place is the sear that my enemies will make it
out to be within the four-hundred-mile fimit, and, in the
second place, I cannot discuss personally with my friends
what I shall have to do, My hesitation about Athens does
not arise from any hope that my fortunes will change.
For many reasons it is desirable for me to stop for a time,
and especially since Ι wish to form definite plans about my
future.

Ι IV.
(An Fam. XIV. 4.)

Terentia, best and most faithful of wives, when you are
not with me, I seem utterly lost. I hope at some time Ι
shall be able ιο make some requital to M. Laenius Flaccus ’
for his hospitality and friendship. If I·go to Cyzicum Ι
shall romain there ten days. You say you regret not being·
able ιο write more often. Should Ι ask you to write
more often Ρ To strengthen the hope of my return,
you regarded no danger to your life, and, though but a
weak woman, you have often reassured me. We have always
acted toward our fellow·men as each one deserved: would
that they had all deserved well of us! Very few of them
now have much sense of duty, excepting the friends who
cannot be deteri-ed from furnishing hope of regaining my
safety. Is we make any mistake‚ I don't know what will
become of my little Tullia. Her marriage and her good name
must be regarded. However matters turn out, Ι would like
you to think me much strengthened by your letters. We
have committed no fault for which we should be robbed,
