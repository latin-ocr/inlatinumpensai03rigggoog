to grant me this indulgence, suited to a Roman citizen.
12. His arrival had been so talked of at Antioch that he
was thought worthy of the acquaintance of all. 13. On
account of the peaceful condition of the state, Greek arts
and systems are cultivated more earnestly here at Rome
than in Antioch. 14. Ι confess that no period of my life
has been wholly given up to this one pursuit. 15. We met
with those consuls of whom the one excelled all in natural
ability, the other in reputation. 16. He held the Luculli
bound [to him] 1by the ties of familiar intercourse, and was
presented with rewards by the inhabitants of Tarentum.

Since Cicero sees that his voice has been the means of
safety to some, and that by his skill aequired by the study
of the liberal arts he has been able to help othere, he
certainly ought, as far as it is in his power, to speak in
defense of the very learned man who is entitled in his own
right to claim the benefit of this discipline. He asks, there-
fore, that the judges will grant him this indulgence, namely,
that they will suffer him to use a style of speaking at vari-
anee with forensic pleading.

If he knows that he will be permitted to speak a little
more freely [than usual] on the study of polite literature,
he will cause them to think that Aulus Licinius is worthy
ot acquaintance and citizenship.

Archias, first at Antioch, afterwards in Greece and Italy,
surpassed all in genius, and was presented with citizenship
by the people of Tarentum, Rhegium, and Neapolis, When
he came to Rome, he was immediately received into the
home of the Luculli. He was pleasing to the consuls, was
cultivated by Crassus, Drusus, and Cato, and held bound
to him by the ties of familiar intercourse all who wished to
learn anything.
