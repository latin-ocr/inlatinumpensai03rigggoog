my little son will be encompassed by a very safe wall, if you

IX. Since these things are so, and γοα have a consul
wh0, forgetful of himself, has preserved the republic from
the midst of dangers, and the temples and shrines of all the
gods from the fite—brands of an impious conspiracy, take
care that you do not fail him and the Roman people. You
see that the common country as a suppliant extends her
hands to you and declares that you must decide to-day con-
cerning the altars of the PenateS, the eternal fire of Vesta,

X. If by your vote, you take upon yourselves so great a
band of enemieS, they will perhaps threaten γοα 911 with
death, but the di gnity of the commonwealth will avail more
than the fury of this very great multitude of conspirators. ,
You will not repent 'your purposes and actions, but the
Roman people having been preserved will thank1 γοα, and
γοα will always abide in the memory of all good [men] and
in the speech and thought of all nationS.

XI. Since Ι shall defend and carry into effect by my
own efforts what γοα shall have decreed concerning the
safety of the city and the dignity of the republic, Ι think
you will deliberate carefully and bravely. In return for
my diligence towards you and the republic Ι ask that the
memory of this time and of my whole consulship be fixed
in your miride, and that you remember that my little son,
whom Ι commend to you, is the son of him by whom a
province was disregarded on account of the care of the
city and of the Roman people.
