PREFAOE.

HE present volume is the second of a series founded on
the Latin authors read ⁸in preparation for college. 11:

is offered in fulfilment of a plan that was announced at the
time of the publication of the part based upon the Com·

mentaries of Caesar.
Some changes in the plan will be observed as the work

proceeds. The Oratione against Catiline are treated
exactly as the Books of Caesar were treated in Part I.
When the student comes to the study of the Oration for
Archiae, he will find the chapters grouped differently, and
more care will be required of him, as it will be necessary
to survey for his models three chapters instead of one. On
account the additional study probably necessary for this
work, the “ Latine Responde” exercises are omitted.
Further, it is thought that, when the student reaches the
Oration for the Manilian Law‚ he will no longer need the
thorough review which is involved in the previous study.
Hence, the exercises presented in connection with that
Oration are intended for a running re-survey, which, per-

haps, can be done largely'at sight.
