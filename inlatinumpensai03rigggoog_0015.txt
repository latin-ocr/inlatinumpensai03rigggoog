IV} Catiline dares not deny that on that former night
he came with his confederates to ‘the house of Marcus

- . Laeca, that he distributed the parts of the city for firing¹;

that he decided who should be left at Rome; that 119 chose
who should go out with him3 and that he found two knights
who promised to kil] the consul. If he ᾱ9111991ῐ,Ι 9111 able
to prove it3. for here 1n our number there are certain [men]
who were at the house of Laeca. on the same night.

V. Since the temples of the immortal gods, the houses
of the city, and the lives of the citizens have been doomed

to destruction, the consul urges the band of conspirators to ·

go out of the city. So foul, so horrible‚ and so dangerous
a curse tothe republic can be esca‘ped, provided only the
immortal gods defend her. If you, Catiline, will do that
⁸ which I command, and lead out with you all your [friends],
Ι shall be freed from great sear, and shall ”return thanks to
the immortal gods and to Jupiter Stator especially..
VI. Gan anything in this city be pleasing‘ to Catilina,
when he knows that there 1s no mark of domestic baseness
which 1s not branded into his life3 that there* 1s no disgrace
of private affairs which does not cling to his reputation;
that the complete ruin of his foi-tunes threatens him upon
the next Ides; that there is no one who does not know that
he has wished to kill the consuls? Neither have his eyes
ever ³been free from lust² his hands from 9111119, 1191 his
body from infamy. Al'l hate and sear him, ⁴on account both
of his private baseness and of those things which pertain
to the highest public weal, and yet he does not cease to
undertake and to wish. ὓ ’
