LATmE semet.

V. If the infamous herd of abandoned men, whose
inheritances have been squandered, whose for-tunes have
been mortgaged‚ ¹go out of the city ²in my consulship,
many ages will be added to the republic. But if they
romain in the city, planning slaughter‚ conflagration‚ and
rapine, plotting against the brave and sober, and belching
out in their conversations the murder of good men, they³
must expect that punishment long since due to‘their worth-
lessness and wickedneSS.

VI. Do you say that Ι sent Catiline into exile? If this
could be accomplished by a word, I should drive you out.
When Catiline came yesterday into the temple of Jupiter
Stator, was he saluted by 'any senator 1> When Ι asked him
whether at the house of Marcus'Laeca he had marked out
the plan of the whole war or not, was he not silent? He
was not driven into exile by me. N ay indeed, he had
already entered upon war, and is now awaited as leader by
that camp which has been pitched in the Faesulan territory.

VII. Now if Catiline has gone into exile to Marseilles,
and is not the leader of enemies‚ it is worth my while to be
considered a very cruel tyrant. But if you do not hear in
three days that an army of enemies is flitting about in arma,
the purpose of Catilina has been changed, and his plan of
making war abandoned. Let me be said to have driven
him into exile through threats of violence, provided only he
be terrified by my diligence‚ and do this which he has never
before thought οἱς but, believe me, he will not do it.
