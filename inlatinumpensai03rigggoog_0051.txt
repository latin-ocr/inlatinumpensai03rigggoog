 

IN CATILINAM—ORATIO Π. ’ 47

Gaius Caesar feels that they ought to be distributed among
the municipalities, and ordains that nobody can ever lighten
the. punishment of those who have attempted to blot out
the name of the Roman people. Even hope is taken away
from those who are condemned, their property is con-
fiscated‚ and only life is left to them.

V. You saw yesterday‚ conscript fathore, that, of those
who had voted custody for Roman citizens and rewards for
' the informers, some one was absent that he might not cast
a vote concerning the lives and property of the accused.
Now it can be doubtful to no one that he who fears popular
outbreaks and is wiHing that consideratione of his own dan·

ger outweigh the advantage of the state, cannot be called a ’

friend of the people.
